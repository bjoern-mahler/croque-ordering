croque-ordering
===============

This sample project is meant for different restful implementations of a croque (or any other lunch you might prefer) ordering application. 
RESTful means that this has to be at least a RESTful Service (a real one, one of these using hypermedia). 

For learning something about ROCA there will be some clients to play with the service as well. 
One real ROCA client with RESTful operations on different resources and a html5+javascript client as a single application with restful links to resources but with javascript and json interaction with the server. So the latter won't be unobtrusive but maybe some compromise between both paradigms, or maybe not ;)
